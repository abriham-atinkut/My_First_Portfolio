    <h1>Rename your local master branch to main</h1>
    <h2><code>git branch -m master main</code></h2>
    <h3>Instead, we'll have to create a new "main" branch and then delete the old "master" branch. The git push -u origin main command will push the local "main" branch to the remote, regardless of which branch is currently checked out (i.e., regardless of where HEAD is pointing).</h3>
    <p>To change the default branch from `master` to `main` both locally and remotely, you'll need to follow these steps: 1. Change the branch name locally: bash git branch -m master main 2. Push the changes to the remote repository: bash git push -u origin main 3.</p>
    <p>Git changed its default branch name from master to main due to concerns about inclusivity and to remove references to terms with problematic historical connotations.</p>
    <p>In this case, Git does a simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.</p>
    <p>Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it.</p>
